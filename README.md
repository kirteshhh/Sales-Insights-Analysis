###📊 Sales Data Analysis Using Python

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a multi-month sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights. The analysis was implemented using Python, primarily leveraging Pandas for data preprocessing and analysis, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of multiple monthly sales CSV files containing order details such as product name, quantity ordered, price, order date, and purchase city. These files were combined into a single dataset to enable comprehensive analysis across time and locations.

🔄 Data Processing Steps

Merged multiple monthly CSV files into a single DataFrame

Removed missing and invalid records to ensure data accuracy

Converted columns to appropriate data types for analysis

Created derived columns such as Sales, Month, Hour, and City to support analysis

❓ Key Questions Answered
1. Best Month for Sales

Analyzed total sales by month to determine which month generated the highest revenue and calculated total earnings for that period.

2. City with Highest Product Sales

Grouped sales data by city to identify the city with the highest total product sales.

3. Optimal Time for Advertisements

Extracted hour information from order timestamps to identify peak purchasing times and determine when advertisements should be displayed for maximum impact.

4. Products Frequently Sold Together

Analyzed orders containing multiple products to find commonly purchased product combinations.

5. Best-Selling Product

Identified the product with the highest sales volume and examined patterns in quantity ordered and pricing to understand why it performed well.
